<!-- Puppy Classes
"Where Excellence in Puppy Training Begins
At Dog Training Revolution, we offer the most exclusive and effective puppy training
classes based on the renowned Life Skills for Puppies program developed by Lincoln
University. Our approach goes beyond obedience, focusing on developing real-life
skills that ensure your puppy grows into a confident, well-behaved dog, ready to face
the world.
Why Choose Our Puppy Training Classes?
Small Group Sizes for Personalised Attention
We limit our puppy classes to small, select groups to provide each owner and puppy
with the intensive, one-to-one tuition they deserve. Our professional trainers give you
the personal focus that larger classes simply can’t offer, ensuring both you and your
puppies receive the highest level of support and guidance.
Real-Life Training for Real-World Results
Our Life Skills for Puppies curriculum emphasises training in real-life situations. From
learning how to be calm and confident in public to managing everyday challenges
like walking on a lead or meeting new people, your puppy will develop essential life
skills that integrate seamlessly into your day-to-day life"

Behaviour Initial assessment 
Some issues require a trained and experienced behaviourist and lucky for you, both Rachel and Laura are just that! In a behavioural assessment, we will visit you and your dog in your home to see them in their environment, have an in-depth talk about their lifestyle, health, social interactions, history and so on. The session will last for up to 2 hours, giving you and your dog the time and support you need for us to gain the best understanding of the issues you're having. We will also go out 'on location' to assess the issue if it's appropriate for the challenges your dog is having. A behavioural assessment is needed for issues such as dog-dog reactivity, human directed aggression, phobias and anxieties, aversion to handling and triggers etc. We believe that changing any behavioural issues requires a holistic approach, which means that you'll also receive a full written assessment of the session and our insight into all aspects of your dogs life that will positively impact and compliment the training going forward. Your mentor will create a personalised management plan for you to start as soon as you can along with training tutorials and support. This option also includes a weekly check in call with your mentor to give you the support you and your dog need in-between sessions. £200

These sessions help us to get to know you and your dog AND to see the challenges you're facing so we can get started together on building a training plan suited specifically for you that you can work on straight away! This option is is suitable for issues with recall, lead walking basics, listening and life skills and so on and will need to be booked before booking further 1-1s or one of our popular packages!

Our Bootcamps are offered to people within a 30minute radius of Leek 5 days: £250 10 days: £500
Behaviour bootcamp
Owning a reactive dog can be a challenge and as behaviourists, we know the time and patience that it takes to be out training and changing your dogs behaviour. With our behavioural Bootcamps, we come and take your dog out for you, an hour each day, to focus on any of the issues that they're having to make positive progress, providing in-depth personalised training to really change their behaviour. These Bootcamps can be booked as 5 or 10 days with session recaps so you can be involved in what they've been doing and how well their training is coming along and of course pictures and videos for memories! We will have a handover session on the last day so you are given everything you need going forward. With this bootcamp, you'll also receive a weekly check-in call with your chosen mentor because let's face it, we need all the support we can get when owning a reactive dog. We are here for you. Our Bootcamps are offered to people living within a 30minute radius of Leek
Walk and Train
Our walk and train sessions are super popular at the moment because they're perfect for topping up and improving training but require less of your time as we come to take your dog out for you! At 45 minutes long, they're a great way to give dedicated 1-1 training with your dog whilst getting their walk in too! Suitable for sporadic or weekly booking. Our walk and train sessions are offered to people within a 30minute radius of Leek £45 per session

Puppy supercharger

"Does my dog need training or behavioural help?" 
It can be a little difficult to know whether your dog needs behavioural or training help so here is a list of some of the differences. There are many more that could be added to these lists so if you’re unsure, please do get in touch. If you book a training option and it later appears that your dog needs behavioural training, we will suggest a different service.
Behavioural: 
Barking and lunging at people and/or dogs Struggles when left home alone Can’t follow training outside if there are dogs, people or cars around Resource guarding Chasing/stalking traffic Barking and/aggressive displays to people coming into or leaving the home Fearfulness/anxiety Reactivity when on walks

training: 
Poor recall on and off lead Pulling on the lead in excitement (not reacting towards people, dogs, cars, animals) Sit, stay, basic obedience Needing calmer behaviour in the house Jumping up people in excitement Wanting to learn skills like retrieving -->

          <p>Laura has been working with our golden retriever Ozzy for a while now, and we still make sure he has a weekly training walk with her! It’s the absolute highlight of his week. When we started training, I was genuinely at a lost cause as to how to make walks enjoyable, he was constantly pulling and I was struggling to control him on lead walks which I used to dread. Since working with Laura, we noticed an instant improvement which has only got better and better. He is a totally different dog. It was in there all along and Laura helped to bring it out of him. We now enjoy daily family walks both on and off the lead and it’s no longer a stress! Cannot recommend her enough. She is so knowledgable about so many things around behaviour, and provided loads of guidance on harnesses, leads, nutrition and more! A 10/10 from us and we will be staying with Laura for as long as she’ll have us 😄</p>
